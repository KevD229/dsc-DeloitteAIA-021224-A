dsc-DeloitteAIA-021224-A 📉📊📈 -  Pandas 🐼 DataFrames 📊🖼

This repository contains materials addressing the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Data Analytics library and goes over how to read in common data files, interact and manipulate Series and DataFrame objects in addition to identifying and handling missing and NaN values. It was sourced from an General AI lab where a small wide-eyed robot was reading a childrens storyfile and suggested it to us... and was brought to you with ❤️ by the Flatiron School.
