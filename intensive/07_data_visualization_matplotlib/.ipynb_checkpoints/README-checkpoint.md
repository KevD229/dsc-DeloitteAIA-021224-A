This repository describes the process of making visualizations with the matplotlib and seaborn (Python) libraries.It contains material that addresses the different ways matplotlib can create visualizations, how we can choose different graph types based on data and problem contexts, how to use matplotlib syntax to adjust elements and improve visualizations and create figures with multiple graphs.
